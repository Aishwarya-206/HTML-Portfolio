<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm a 2nd year CSE student, beginner web developer and an artist who loves learning by doing. This portfolio is my little playground where I experiment with HTML and build simple webpages to practice and improve my skills step by step. Each project here reflects what I've learned so far and serves as a milestone in my ongoing journey into coding. Alongside coding, I enjoy drawing, painting, and creating art from recycled materials combining creativity with technology is what excites me most and keeps me inspired every day. I believe that blending artistic expression with technical skills opens up endless possibilities for unique and meaningful creations. I'm excited to keep learning, building, and sharing my progress here as I grow my abilities and take on new challenges. Thanks so much for stopping by and exploring my work!</p>
